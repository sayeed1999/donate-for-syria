      <h1>Let's Help Those Who Are More In Need</h1>
      <p>
        For many children in Syria, war is the only thing they know. They
        continue to live in fear of violence, landmines, and explosive remnants
        of war. They struggle with physical and psychological scars of war. In
        2021, a third of children in Syria showed signs of psychological
        distress including anxiety, sadness, fatigue, or frequent trouble
        sleeping.
